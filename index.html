      <h1>The Push Train</h1>
      <p>
        This is a presentation I've given about managing the human side of continuous delivery.
        In my experience, the challenges of deploying dozens of times per day are mostly
        interpersonal rather than technical.

            Let me tell you a quick story. In 2008, Etsy’s engineering founders parted ways with the company. And those folks meant well, but they had been gatekeeping production pretty hard. We had not really been able to touch the site, and now we were about to expected to.<br /><br />There was also no production monitoring to speak of. We suddenly found ourselves out to sea.

            My reaction to this was to start writing some integration tests. Using selenium, that web driver toolkit zenefits used to break the law.

            The thing you should know about writing web-driving integration tests is that doing this well is at least as hard as writing a multithreaded program. And that’s a domain where human competence isn’t estimated to be high. The other problem with testing across process boundaries is that failure is a thing that can’t be entirely avoided.<br /><br />So what you tend to wind up with there is a lot of tests that work most of the time. Even if you’re really good and prevent most race conditions, you’re still going to have some defects. Given enough tests, that means that one is always failed.

            Github is likewise oriented around open source libraries, and it may be great for that, but there’s no reason to suspect that things you do there should work as well for building an online application.<br /><br />But the tendency among engineers is to start with Github, and all of the workflow and cultural baggage that surrounds it. Then they bang on stuff from there until something’s in production.<br />
